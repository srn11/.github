Just as textbooks are crafted to enhance human learning, our mission is to design "textbooks" for machines. To do this, we are developing innovative methods, inspired by multi-modal data translation, to represent and synthesize data for training and tuning AI/ML models. Our focus is on enhancing the generalization capabilities of these models, minimizing their size, and lowering dependence on unreliable, copyrighted, and unethical data sources.
